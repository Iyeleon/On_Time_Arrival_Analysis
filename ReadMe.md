# On-time Arrival Analysis
At face value, this project is about predicting on-time arrivals. However, it is primarily concerned with comprehending the spatio-temporal dynamics of the bus transit system and how they contribute towards equitable accessibility and usability across diverse populations and geographics. The project aims to combine this equity lens with an analysis of the immediate urban context to glean insights into the challenges of the bus transit system and identify optimal predictors of on-time arrival.

This project starts with a series of demographic, contextual, and socio-economic questions to guide the exploration of user profiles, estimating transportation needs and quantifying factors affecting bus operations. Questions on population density, commercial density, neighbourhood types, road characteristics and transit infrastructure inform approaches to identify issues within the transit system. Additionally, questions on income distribution, the proximity of, and commute time to transit stops inform approaches to measuring accessibility to bus trains and the fairness of accessibility across the city.
